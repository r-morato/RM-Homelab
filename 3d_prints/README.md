# Custom 3D Prints

This section documents all the custom 3D printed components used in the homelab rack. These prints enable clean integration of non-rack-standard hardware while maximizing space, airflow, and modularity.

All models are either downloaded from trusted sources or custom-designed to fit this specific build.

## üß† Design Considerations

Each 3D printed part was created or selected with the following goals in mind:

- **Space Optimization**  
  Designed to fit devices snugly in a 10-inch rack, avoiding wasted vertical or horizontal space.

- **Airflow Maintenance**  
  Mounts are open where needed to avoid blocking fans or vents.

- **Modularity & Maintenance**  
  Most mounts are tool-less or use captive screws for easy removal, allowing for hardware swaps or upgrades without tearing down the rack.

## üõ†Ô∏è Future Print Ideas

A few designs are in progress or under consideration to further improve the setup:

- Mount for **Eero Mesh 6**
- Enclosure or rack-mount bracket for **ESP32 eInk display**
- **Cable management trays**, clips, or combs specific to the aluminum profile structure
